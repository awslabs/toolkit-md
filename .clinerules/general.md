# Project guidelines

ALWAYS use `yarn` instead of `npm`.

When adding comments to a Typescript file ALWAYS make them compatible with `typedoc`.

The repository is structured like so:

- `src`: Application source code
- `tests`: Unit tests for code

## Project README

When making changes to the project README:

1. Do not exhaustively list things supported, like languages. This makes the README harder to maintain as these options change.
